# 3rd Security in Organizations Project 2021/2022 - We were hacked?

This assignment will focus on the security mechanisms of Linux systems, and the analysis of an attack chain according to the MITRE Attack Matrix. The matrix lists the typical Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) used by an attacker when developing an attack, and specifically, the mechanisms that are explored to inject code, get persistence and remote control, break confinement, get additional permissions, exfiltrate data and hide their activities. Finally the motivations of an typical attacker.
